About Me
======
Hey, I'm Tim! 

I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Quantitative and Computational Finance, with a strong interest in machine learning and data science. I previously graduated with a bachelor's in Information Systems also from Georgia Tech in December 2024. I have taken several courses in financial mathematics, data analysis, and machine learning. I have experience with machine learning methods and data science. This is where my interests generally lie and I hope to continue working on some fun personal projects outside of class this summer!
