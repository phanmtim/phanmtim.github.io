title: "Detecting Flash Crash Precursors in Bitcoin Market Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning"
excerpt: "We investigated whether flash crashes in the Bitcoin market can be predicted using features derived from high-frequency order book data. Our approach compared supervised models like Random Forests with unsupervised autoencoders to detect pre-crash anomalies, achieving strong results with both. The findings suggest that microstructure signals—such as liquidity imbalances and bid-ask spreads—hold predictive value in the crypto space.
