title: "Multi‐Model Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimization"
excerpt: "We developed a multi-model Monte Carlo framework to optimize equity portfolios under realistic price and interest-rate dynamics. By simulating paths from Geometric Brownian Motion, Merton jump-diffusion, CEV, and Heston models—alongside Vasicek, CIR, and Ho-Lee rate scenarios—we identified stable asset allocations that consistently maximized Sharpe ratio. Adding vanilla options further enhanced returns, demonstrating how structured overlays can improve risk-adjusted performance even under stochastic market conditions.<br/><img src='/images/gbm sim.png' style='width:100%; max-width:1000px; '>"
