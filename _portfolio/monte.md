title: "Multi‚ÄêModel Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimization"
excerpt: "Developed a multi-model Monte Carlo framework to optimize equity portfolios under realistic price and interest-rate dynamics. Simulated asset paths using Geometric Brownian Motion, Merton jump-diffusion, CEV, and Heston models alongside Vasicek, CIR, and Ho-Lee rate scenarios to identify allocations that maximized Sharpe ratio. Enhanced risk-adjusted performance by incorporating vanilla options that reduced downside exposure while preserving upside potential.<br/><img src='/images/gbm sim.png' style='width:100%; max-width:1000px; '>"
