title: "Predicting New Bike Shares"
excerpt: "Conducted a detailed exploratory analysis on a bike-sharing dataset and identified “hour of the day” as a key predictor of usage patterns. Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models—including Random Forest, Feedforward Neural Network, and Gradient Boosting Machine—using K-fold cross validation. Model performance was assessed using MSE and RMSE, with the Random Forest achieving the best results (RMSE: 258.57).<br/><img src='/images/bikeshares.png' style='width:100%; max-width:1000px; '>"
